If you punch an old lady because somebody is going to kill your family if you don\'t, you\'re a less-bad (arguably good) person. Most of the blame transfers from you personally, to the person who made you do it.\n\nThis is relevant here, because the ease (and therefore agency of) of these two actions (not eating meat, and not directly or indirectly supporting an unethical organisation) are vastly different.\n\nI\'m a vegetarian, though not a vegan, and I can tell you that it\'s trivially easy. Literally the only time it\'s ever been remotely tricky is avoiding sweets with gelatin in. People assume that it\'s hard to (healthily) avoid meat, but when you have the right habits it\'s effortless. The idea that it\'s hard just comes from people who don\'t know how to do it. It doesn\'t have to be expensive, either.\n\nOn the other hand, let\'s count the bad organisations I\'m supporting right now.\n\nWell, we\'re discussing this on reddit, which is part-owned by Tencent, a Chinese company. Reddit\'s also part-owned by Jared Leto, who has a number of credible sexual-assault accusations to his name.

Oh, this coffee-cup was made in China too, and I bet the people who made this top I\'m wearing weren\'t well-paid. You get the picture, there\'re LOTS of ways that we\'re all supporting immoral organisations.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would all avoid supporting immoral organisations, but the way the world is set up at the moment, our ability/agency to do so is very limited. You\'d pretty much have to live in an off-the-grid hut in the woods or something, with home-made everything.\n\nOn the other hand, as I can tell you personally, it\'s pretty damn easy to be vegetarian.\n\nModulating moral-judgement by agency here, eating meat is significantly worse because it\'s a choice that you\'re making and therefore bear responsibility for, whereas supporting immoral organisations is less so because you have less ability to avoid it.'), (Comment(id='f6u90ws'), "That's an awfully, awfully specific scenario there tc.

This is problematic but the main way I\'d like to change your view is with the premise that if you\'re willing to engage in behavior you do not approve of, then you actually do approve of the behavior. If you normally would say "calling someone a murderer for being merely part of the problem is wrong" but this belief is immediately cast aside when you\'re called a murderer, then you\'re really saying "I\'m against being called a murderer for being merely part of the problem, but this opinion changes when it happens to me. In that case, it\'s ok for me to do it." That\'s just selective logic. More importantly, it makes whatever principle of politeness on which you stand incredibly feeble. I\'ll end with a quote from Einstein discussing Gandhi: I believe that Gandhi\'s views are the most enlightened of all the political men in our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit. Not by using violence when fighting for our cause, but by non participation in anything you believe is evil."
